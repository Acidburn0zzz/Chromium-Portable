### A small application to automatically update Chromium, but also to quickly install or uninstall the browser from your computer with ease

_Written by **Giorgiana Arghire** on July 4th, 2013_

[Chromium](http://chromium.woolyss.com/), the browser that represents the basis
of [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95346?hl=en), is used by numerous people over the world due to its handy
functions and its ease of use. In addition, it also received updates on a
regular basis, and those who want to make sure they do not miss any one of
them can try Chromium Auto Updater.


It needs to be mentioned from the beginning that the application can only run
on operating systems newer than Windows Vista, so those still running older
OSes need to look elsewhere for the same functions.


The application is a command-line utility that is mainly targeted at expert
users as adjusting its settings require some computer skills that novices will
most likely not have. Nonetheless, reading the documentation might offer some
helpful instructions.


Despite its name, Chromium Auto Updater can also be used to install
[Chromium](http://www.softpedia.com/get/PORTABLE-SOFTWARE/Internet/Browsers
/Portable-Google-Chrome-Chromium.shtml) if the browser is not detected on the
host computer, then add a new job to the Windows Task Scheduler so as to
update Chromium on a daily basis, in the evening. This is one of the settings
that can be modified by those with the proper knowledge.


Whenever users want to uninstall Chromium from their system, they can rely on
Chromium Auto Updater once again, as it includes a utility that can remove the
browser from their PC with as little user input as possible.


Overall, Chromium Auto Updater provides users with a quick and efficient way
to install and remove Chromium, without wasting their time with complex
graphic user interfaces or complicated buttons and menus. The browser can also
be kept up-to-date without additional effort, so one can enjoy new features or
bug fixes as soon as they are released.
